As the above epigraph underscores,problematizing thought is defined byits commitment to 'the endeavour to know how and to what extent it mightbe possible to think differently,instead of legitimating what is alreadyknown'.Indeed,as Foucault notes (1985:9),his own critical studies are bestunderstood as a 'philosophical exercise'in just this sense.Moreover,integralto the challenge of learning to come to think differently is a commitment tothe 'development of a given into a question';this,Foucault adds,'is what con-stitutes the point of problematization,and the specific work of thought'(1984d:389).Further,problematizing critique presupposes the ability'to stepback from [a]way of acting or reacting,to present it to oneself as an objectof thought and question it as to its meaning,its conditions,and its goals'.
Ultimately,then,'thought is freedom in relation to what one does,the motionby which one detaches oneself from it,establishes it as an object,and reflectson it as a problem'(1984d:388).Importantly,too,problematizing critiquehinges on 'a critical interrogation on the present and on ourselves (1984a:49-50),as evidenced,for example,in Foucault's own studies of 'madness andillness arising out of social and medical practices',and of 'crime and criminalbehaviour emerging from certain punitive practises conforming to a "disci-plinary"model'(Foucault,1985:12;cf.1984c;1984d:386-90).
